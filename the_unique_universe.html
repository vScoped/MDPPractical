                <h1 id="life">Life on Other Planets?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Earlier we discussed that Earth’s distance from the sun means the temperature is suitable for the creation of life. By using this we can suppose that other solar systems are able to hold life. In fact, it has been scientifically proven that every 1 in 7 solar systems have a planet that is very similar to Earth.
                    <br>
                    Because of how we have transformed over the millions of years we look the way we are now. However, if we were to have been on another planet in a different solar system, then we would look completely different. If life were to be on other planets out of our reach, then it may take on many forms based on the planet’s properties. 
                </p>

        <p>What would aliens look like? How would they behave?
            <br><br>
            These questions have been attempted to be answered in movies, whether they are scary or cute or destructive or peaceful. But the aliens never look the same, even in our eyes.
            <br>
            It is possible for there to be aliens, but they are much too far out of our reach to be of any worry. Also, there is no known 'look' to aliens and they can take any different forms and act in any type of way.
            </p>

                <h2>Galaxies:</h2>
                <p>
                    Galaxies are a bundle of solar systems, much like ours, that are connected by each other’s gravity. The galaxy that we are in is called ‘The Milky Way’.
                    When you look up in the sky and see a line of lots of stars you are able to see towards the centre of our galaxy as Earth is actually further on the outside of the galaxy.</p>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <h2>Blackholes</h2>
            <p>A black hole is an object in space with a large amount of mass packed into a tiny area. This creates such a large gravitational pull that will suck in other objects until it becomes part of the blackhole. These blackholes travel through space ‘eating’ anything that comes near it, including asteroids, planets and even suns. What makes blackholes so interesting is that their gravity is so strong that it sucks up light, creating a ring of light around the black sphere at its centre.
            <br><br>
                Not to worry, there is almost a 0% percent chance that a blackhole will come even remotely close to us.</p>

            <h3>Asteroids and Comets</h3>
            <p>Asteroids and comets are large chunks of rock that are a result of two large objects colliding, that are now flying through space with high speeds. Asteroids and comets have a chance of hitting other objects and creating even more asteroids and comets.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Meteor</h3>
                <p>Another small object in space is a meteor which is an asteroid which is so small that it burns up when it gets near a planet
                </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Whats the Difference?</h3>
            <p>The differences between asteroids and comets are that comets are made up of ice, dusk and rocks whilst asteroids are only made up of rocks and comets orbit around a sun, unlike asteroids which are travelers.
                <br><br>
                Because they are such small objects compared to stars and planets, asteroids usually come into orbit of another object, creating moon and sometimes even rings around planets.

                <p>
                    Saturn’s Belt is a rare occurance where comets and asteroids broke up before reaching the planet’s surface because of such a strong gravity.
                    These remaining pieces of rock were pulled into a circle surrounding the planet forming a protective belt that stops more asteroids from reaching the planet’s surface.
